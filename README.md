# Movies-ETL
## Overview
Amazing Prime is the client we are working for. I have been working with Britta their employee on preparing for the upcoming hackathon. We have been asked to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We will do this by refactoring some code from previous functions and use data files from Wikipedia, MovieLens. These files are .csv and JSON file types. We then add this data to a PostgreSQL Database. 
First thing we created was an ETL function to read three data files, extracting and transforming the Wikipedia Data and again the Kaggle Data. Lastly, we created the Movie Database in PostgresSQL.
